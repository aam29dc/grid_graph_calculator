# grid_graph_calculator (WIP)
SDL2 Grid, graph equations, graphics calculator
- graphs algebraic functions and evaluates expressions
  - zoom in/out, shift left/right, up/down of the graph
- prevents invalid input from being entered into expression ( example: can't press decimal . twice to get .. which is always invalid)

#### TODO
- in general similar design to windows calculator
