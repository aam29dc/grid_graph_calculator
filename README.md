# grid_graph_calculator
SDL2 Grid, graph equations, graphics calculator

**[ Currently making a full graphics calculator app, WIP]**

*[0.5.1] Fixed drawFunction: it was adding dx twice to next f(x). Lines should be connected continuously now on all level of iterations.*

*[0.5] Fixed zoom effect, simplified expressions, zoom starts at 1, removed scale variable, etc; polished code.
Now when you zoom past zero it flips both the axises. (This is like zooming in to infinity, then going on the 'other side' to a mirror universe)*

**Just like a graphing Calculator:**

--Zoom in/out (press `minus`/`plus`),
  
--scroll left, right, up, down (press `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`)

--press `esc` to scape, and press `o` or `0` to recenter graph, reset settings
